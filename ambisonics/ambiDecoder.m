function [D, order] = ambiDecoder(ls_dirs, method, decoderWeight, order)
%AMBIDECODER Returns a HOA decoding matrix for a loudspeaker setup.
% AMBIDECODER computed a HOA decoding matrix for a loudspeaker setup, based
% on one of five implemented decoder designs. The methods are:
%   - Sampling decoder (SAD)
%   - Mode-matching decoder (MMD)
%   - Energy-preserving decoder (EPAD)
%   - All-round ambisonic panning (ALLRAD)
%   - Constant Angular Spread Decoder (CSAD)
%
%   The two first ones are traditional design approaches. The last three
%   ones are recently proposed design methods that are more flexible and
%   more psychoacoustically motivated. For references, check the
%   TEST_AMBI_SCRIPT.m. Additionally, the so-called max-rE weighting can be
%   enabled for all of the above decoders apart from CSAD. The max-rE
%   weighting maximises the norm of the energy vector for all decoding
%   directions, which in ambisonic literature is considered to reduce 
%   localization blur.
%
% Inputs:   
%   ls_dirs: speaker directions in [azi1 elev1; azi2 elev2;... ; aziL elevL]
%            convention, in degrees, for L loudspeakers in the layout
%   method:  {'SAD','MMD','EPAD','ALLRAD','CSAD'} for any one of the 
%            respective decoding methods
%   decoderWeight:  0 for no weighting. 1 for max rE and 2 for inPhase. 
%               If CSAD is chosen, then this does nothing.
%   order:      Ambisonic order of the array. If it is left blank, then an
%               equivalent ambisonic order is computed by
%               getLayoutAmbisonicOrder().
%
% Outputs:
%   D:      The [L x (order+1)^2] ambisonic decoding matrix
%   order:  The order of the layout, useful to see what it is if it is not 
%           defined and it is computed internally.
